# Power Supply
###### This component connects to the motherboard to supply the electricity needed to send those electric signals throughout the circuit board. However it needs to do so carefully as to not give too much power to ruin the motherboard itself and the components attached like those utilizing the PCIE slots. Power supplies may have labels that say something like 305-watt max like the image below. What this means is that the power supply takes power from a wall outlet and converts it to a lower wattage (*AC to DC*)
