# Cooling
###### Most PC's use fans to cool the inside of the case, which makes sense considering all of the components of a PC run on electricity so when they become overworked or even just regular worked adequate airflow is vital to maintain the functional temperatures that are just right to let the computer run but not too hot as to ruin components.

###### Some computers use liquid cooling which I personally think is really cool and looks something like the image below. Liquid cooling uses the same principles as air cooling but instead works a lot better at maintaining low operating temepratures due to the heat capacity of water. Liquid cooling involves a radiator, two hoses with hot/cool liquid coolant, and a water block that's attached directly to the CPU.
