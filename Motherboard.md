# Motherboard
###### The motherboard is probably the most crucial of all the components of any computer. The motherboard is tasked with communicating with all other components of the computer and keep them connected so they can be used. The components that the motherboard connects are as follows:
  * ###### RAM
  * ###### HDD/SDD
  * ###### Peripherals
  * ###### CPU
  * ###### Sound Card
  * ###### Video Card
  * ###### Cooling
###### The motherboard essentially is that it works in its own way as a circuit board that uses electric currents to connect all the parts linked together.
