# The Central Processing Unit or CPU for short
###### Typically CPU's are given speeds measured in GHZ or billion herz/second, i.e. an '05 Intel Core 2 has a speed of 1.86 GHZ, showing the frequency of the clock in the CPU which just means how much *happens* in a time span (1.86 GHZ/second). Nowadays however, an Intel Core i9 for example can have up to 6.0 GHZ/second (roughly **6x** higher speeds in only 19 years).

###### The CPU's primary purpose is to handle all the math, i/o (input/output), and logic. There isn't a *single* action that happens on a computer that doesn't first flow through the CPU.
