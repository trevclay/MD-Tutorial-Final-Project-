# Memory Storage and SATA
###### SATA refers to a connection type on modern data storage components, SATA stands for Serial Advanced Technology Attachment and exists in both SDD and HDD (Solid State Drive & Hard Disk Drive respectfully). 
  * ###### SDD: As a solid state drive, SSD's are pretty *solid* and don't have any moving parts, and are generally faster than HDD's.
  * ###### HDD: HDD's on the other hand rely on disks (hence the *hard* disk drive) and magnets which makes them more prone to hardware malfunction and are generally slower than SDD's however they do have higher data storage.
