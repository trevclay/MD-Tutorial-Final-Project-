# Video Card/Graphics Card
###### The video card or graphics card is a card more or less that fits into the mother board in one of the PCIE slots, and contains a GPU (graphics processing unit) that is responsible for image generation and is itself a processor. Because it is a processor, it can be used quite well to handle geometric related problems which reinforces the infinite number of shapes needed to render the graphics it's tasked with rendering.
